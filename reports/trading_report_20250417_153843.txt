MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown some volatility, with recent price action suggesting a potential for both bullish and bearish movements. The RSI indicates slightly oversold conditions, which might suggest a potential for a rebound. However, the MACD is below its signal line, indicating bearish momentum. The price is currently below the MA_20 but above MA_50, suggesting mixed signals. The upcoming CPI data for the USD could introduce significant volatility. Considering the mixed sentiment and the bearish institutional bias, there's a cautious approach towards taking new positions.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Consider an early exit if the price breaks below the new stop loss level or if there's a significant bearish reversal pattern ahead of the USD CPI data release.
Partial Profit Taking: If the market moves in favor, consider taking partial profits at 1.13800, 1.14000, and re-evaluating the position before the 1.14200 level in light of market response to upcoming economic events.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a lack of wins, indicating a potential misalignment between strategy application and market conditions. The use of mean reversion in a volatile market ahead of significant economic announcements may not have been the optimal approach.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, adjusting strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on trend following and breakout strategies might be more appropriate. This adjustment would align better with the expected market volatility from upcoming economic data releases.
