MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bearish trend on the H1 timeframe with recent price action indicating potential for reversal as it approaches key support levels. The Moving Averages indicate a near-term bearish bias but with potential for reversal as prices are close to MA20 and MA50, suggesting consolidation. RSI is below 50, indicating bearish momentum but nearing oversold conditions which could lead to a potential bounce. The MACD is below the signal line but the histogram is very close to zero, indicating weakening bearish momentum. Intermarket correlations and economic events suggest a cautious approach due to upcoming high-impact USD CPI data which could increase volatility. Market sentiment is neutral with a slight bullish bias among retail traders.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a tendency towards trend following strategies under conditions that may not fully support such decisions. The market's response to economic events and technical indicators suggests a need for a more nuanced approach, particularly in times of high volatility and ahead of major economic announcements.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, it would be prudent to adjust the strategy weights slightly in favor of mean reversion and breakout strategies, considering the market's current volatility and the proximity to key support and resistance levels. A proposed adjustment could be trend_following: 0.4, breakout: 0.35, mean_reversion: 0.25.
