MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bullish trend on the H1 and H4 timeframes, with prices oscillating around key moving averages. The RSI at 63 indicates a moderately overbought condition but still provides room for upward movement. The MACD is positive, suggesting continued bullish momentum. However, the market sentiment is neutral, with a nearly even split between bullish and bearish perspectives among traders. The upcoming USD CPI data could significantly impact the pair, potentially strengthening the USD if the data exceeds forecasts. Intermarket correlations show a moderate positive relationship between EUR/USD and GBP/USD, and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, indicating that changes in interest rate differentials could influence EUR/USD price movements.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in upcoming USD CPI data from forecasts, indicating a stronger USD. Also, a reversal pattern on the H1 or H4 timeframe or significant bearish news event could warrant an early exit.
Partial Profit Taking: If a new trade were to be opened, profits could be taken at key resistance levels identified by technical analysis, with a trailing stop to protect gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not met the target daily profit, indicating a need for adjustment in strategy or better alignment with market conditions. The current market analysis suggests a cautious approach due to upcoming high-impact economic events and a neutral market sentiment.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the upcoming economic events, it might be prudent to adjust the strategy weights slightly towards mean reversion and breakout strategies, considering the potential for increased market volatility. Trend following remains relevant but requires careful entry point selection to avoid entering during overextended moves.
