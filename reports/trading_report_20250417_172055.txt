MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing mixed signals across different timeframes, with a slight bearish bias in market sentiment and recent price action. The recent ECB Interest Rate Decision and the upcoming CPI data from the US could introduce volatility. The technical indicators show a slight bearish momentum with the MACD below the signal line and the RSI near the neutral 50 level, indicating a lack of strong momentum in either direction. The price is currently below the MA20 but above the MA50, suggesting a potential for both trend continuation and reversal. Given the bearish market sentiment and the anticipation of USD strength from the upcoming CPI data, a cautious approach is warranted.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a mix of outcomes, indicating a need for refinement in entry criteria and better alignment with market sentiment and economic events. The risk management strategy has been effective in limiting losses, but there's room for improvement in identifying winning trades.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and mixed success of recent trades, it would be prudent to adjust strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on economic events and market sentiment. This could involve a more cautious approach to trend-following strategies in times of expected high volatility and a greater reliance on mean reversion in stable conditions.
