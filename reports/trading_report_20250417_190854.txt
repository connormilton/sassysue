MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing mixed signals across different timeframes. The H1 and H4 timeframes indicate a slight bearish bias with the price consistently closing below the MA20 but above the MA50, suggesting a potential for short-term consolidation or reversal. The daily timeframe shows a recent uptick towards resistance levels around 1.14094, indicating a bullish sentiment in the longer term. The MACD is near a crossover, and the RSI is neutral, suggesting no clear momentum. Given the upcoming high-impact USD CPI data, market volatility is expected. Intermarket correlations show a strong positive correlation with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, indicating EUR strength could be influenced by broader USD movements.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades show a balanced approach towards trend following, with mixed outcomes. The market's response to economic events and technical setups suggests a need for a more nuanced approach, especially in times of high volatility and ahead of major economic releases.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, it would be prudent to adjust strategy weights slightly towards mean reversion ( and post major economic releases, given the expected volatility. Adjusting the weights to trend_following: 0.4, closely monitoring with breakout:-event strategies: 0.4 and mean_reversion post-event: 0 0.3, could capitalize on expected-market movements and potential reversals post-event.
