MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing mixed signals across different timeframes. The H1 and H4 charts indicate a consolidation phase with a slight bearish bias given the recent price action closing near the lower end of its range and the moving averages (MA20 and MA50) showing a minor bearish crossover potential. The Daily timeframe suggests a broader bullish sentiment but with recent pullbacks. The upcoming USD CPI data and EUR Industrial Production could introduce volatility. The sentiment is bearish, and retail positioning is heavily long, suggesting potential for a squeeze if bearish momentum continues. Intermarket correlations show a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, indicating EUR weakness against USD strength.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A significant break below 1.1340 or above 1.1380 on H1 timeframe, indicating a clear direction. Additionally, a stronger than expected USD CPI could warrant an exit if in a BUY position.
Partial Profit Taking: If a trade is entered, consider taking partial profits at 20 pips intervals, reassessing market conditions at each stage.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not capitalized on the market's range-bound nature, suggesting a need to refine the strategy to better adapt to consolidation phases. The risk management has been effective in keeping losses within acceptable limits.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of trend-following strategies in a volatile, range-bound market, it might be prudent to increase the weight of mean-reversion strategies to 0.4 and decrease trend-following to 0.3, keeping breakout strategies at 0.3. This adjustment reflects the market's current indecision and the potential for reversion plays within established ranges.
