MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bullish trend in the recent hours, with the price action hovering above both the MA20 and MA50, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. The RSI at 56.99 suggests the market is not yet overbought, providing room for further upside. The MACD is above its signal line, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. However, the market sentiment is neutral with a slight bearish institutional bias, suggesting caution. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. Given the current technical setup and considering the economic calendar, there's a potential for bullish continuation, but risks from upcoming economic events should be managed carefully.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in USD CPI data from forecasts indicating stronger USD, reversal patterns on H1 or H4 timeframes, or a shift in market sentiment to strongly bearish for EUR/USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Consider taking partial profits at 1.1390 and moving the stop loss to break-even to protect the remainder of the position. Further profits could be taken at 1.1405, with the final target at 1.1420, adjusting the trailing stop to lock in gains as the price moves favorably.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a bullish bias based on trend-following strategies. While the direction aligns with the current market trend, the outcomes are yet to be determined. The risk management strategy, including stop loss adjustments and trailing stops, appears to be in line with maintaining a balanced risk-reward ratio.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the neutral to slightly bearish market sentiment and upcoming economic events, it may be prudent to adjust strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on mean reversion in anticipation of potential market volatility. This adjustment could provide more flexibility in capturing short-term price movements.
