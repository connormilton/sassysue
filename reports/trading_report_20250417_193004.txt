MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing a mixed sentiment with a bullish bias according to market sentiment data. The recent price action on the H1 timeframe indicates a slight bearish trend with the price moving below the MA20 but still above the MA50, suggesting potential for reversal or consolidation. The MACD is close to a bullish crossover, and the RSI is near the oversold territory, indicating potential upward momentum. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. Intermarket correlations show a positive relationship with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggesting EUR strength against the USD might be influenced by broader USD weakness or EUR strength.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A significant deviation in the upcoming USD CPI data from the forecast, indicating stronger USD strength, or a break below key support levels on the H1 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A as no new trade is recommended at this moment.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a balanced approach between trend following and mean reversion strategies. However, the market's mixed signals and the upcoming high-impact economic events suggest a cautious approach is warranted. The success of the open positions should be closely monitored, especially with the upcoming USD CPI data, which could significantly impact the USD strength.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, it might be beneficial to adjust the strategy weights slightly in favor of mean reversion strategies in the short term, especially in anticipation of market reactions to upcoming economic events. This adjustment could capitalize on potential short-term reversals following the news release.
