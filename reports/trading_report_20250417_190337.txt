MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bearish trend on the H1 timeframe with a recent close below the MA20, indicating potential for further downside. However, the proximity of the price to the MA50 suggests a possible support level. The MACD is slightly below the signal line, suggesting bearish momentum, but the closeness indicates potential for a reversal. The RSI is below 50, aligning with the bearish sentiment but not yet in the oversold territory, suggesting there might be room for further downward movement before a potential reversal. The ATR indicates moderate volatility, providing room for price movement. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the data exceeds forecasts. The current sentiment is neutral with a slight retail bias towards short positions, suggesting mixed market opinions.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades show a mix of buy and sell positions, indicating an attempt to capitalize on short-term fluctuations. However, the lack of wins suggests a need for better alignment with prevailing market conditions and perhaps a more nuanced approach to interpreting technical indicators and economic events.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, it might be prudent to adjust the strategy weights slightly in favor of mean reversion, considering the potential for price corrections after significant moves. Adjusting the weights to trend_following: 0.4, breakout: 0.3, mean_reversion: 0.3 could provide a better balance.
