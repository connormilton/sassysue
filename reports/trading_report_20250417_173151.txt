MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has been showing a consolidation pattern with a slight bearish sentiment in the market, as indicated by the recent price action and market sentiment data. The technical indicators suggest a mixed view, with the moving averages indicating a potential for both support and resistance in the near term. The MACD is slightly bearish, while the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting a lack of strong momentum. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the data exceeds expectations. Considering the mixed technical signals and the bearish market sentiment, a cautious approach is warranted.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A break below the new stop loss level (1.1345) or an unexpected bullish surge in USD strength following the CPI data release would be conditions for an early exit. Additionally, a reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe or a significant shift in market sentiment towards further bearishness would also prompt an early exit.
Partial Profit Taking: Given the current market conditions, partial profits should be taken more conservatively. If the market moves in favor of the position, consider taking partial profits at the first take profit level (1.1380) and reassess the market conditions before deciding on the next steps for the remaining position.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a need for a more cautious approach given the mixed market signals and the bearish sentiment. The strategy should be adjusted to account for market sentiment and upcoming economic events more significantly, potentially reducing risk exposure in uncertain conditions.
Strategy Adjustments: Increase the weight on mean reversion in times of high volatility and uncertainty, as it may offer safer, short-term opportunities. Additionally, refine the trend-following and breakout strategies to incorporate a broader set of technical and sentiment indicators, improving the decision-making process in mixed signal environments.
