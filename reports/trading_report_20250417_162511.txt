MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a slight bearish trend on the H1 timeframe, with prices recently moving below the MA20 but still above the MA50, indicating potential for short-term downside but overall market indecision. The RSI is near the 40 level, suggesting slight bearish momentum without being oversold. The MACD is below the signal line, supporting the bearish view. However, considering the upcoming USD CPI data, volatility is expected. The market sentiment is bullish, and the recent trades show mixed results, indicating a divided market view. The correlation with GBP/USD and Gold suggests external market factors could influence EUR/USD movements.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: SELL
Entry Price: 1.13566
Stop Loss: 1.1375
Take Profit Levels: [1.133, 1.131, 1.129]
Risk Percent: 2.0%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: Given the slight bearish momentum indicated by the RSI and MACD, along with the price action moving below the MA20, a SELL position is supported. The entry range is chosen based on recent consolidation, with a stop loss above the recent high to mitigate risk. The take profit levels are set at key psychological and technical support levels, allowing for staged profit-taking. The upcoming USD CPI data could increase volatility, potentially strengthening the USD and pushing EUR/USD lower.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe or a break above the 1.13750 level indicating a false breakout.
Partial Profit Taking: Take partial profits at each specified level, moving the stop loss to break even after the first target is reached to protect from downside risk.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades show a need to better align with market sentiment and economic events. The mixed results indicate a potential over-reliance on technical analysis without adequately considering upcoming high-impact news events.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the upcoming economic events, adjusting the strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on trend following might be prudent, especially in times of expected high volatility. This adjustment would prioritize momentum and trend direction, potentially increasing the win rate.
