MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing a mixed signal across various timeframes, with a slight bullish bias in the short term as indicated by the recent price action above the MA_20 and MA_50 on the H1 timeframe. The RSI is in the bullish territory but not yet overbought, suggesting there might be room for upward movement. However, market sentiment is bearish, and the upcoming USD CPI event could introduce volatility. The correlation analysis indicates EUR/USD has a positive correlation with GBP/USD and Gold, which could provide additional clues on EUR/USD direction based on movements in these markets.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in USD CPI data from forecasts, reversal patterns on H1 or H4, or a shift in market sentiment to strongly bearish.
Partial Profit Taking: If a trade were to be placed, taking partial profits at each take-profit level while adjusting the stop loss to break-even or using a trailing stop to protect gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades indicate a reliance on trend-following strategies without adequate consideration for market sentiment or upcoming economic events. This oversight may have contributed to the current 0% win rate.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the mixed signals and upcoming high-impact economic events, it would be prudent to adjust strategy weights to place more emphasis on mean reversion and breakout strategies in the short term. This adjustment would account for the potential volatility and provide more balanced exposure to different market conditions.
