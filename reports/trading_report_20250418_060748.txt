MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a slight bullish trend on the H1 timeframe, with prices moving above the MA_20 and MA_50, indicating potential for further upside. The RSI at 63 suggests the market is not yet overbought, providing room for upward movement. The MACD is positive, indicating bullish momentum. However, market sentiment is bearish, with a higher percentage expecting a price decline. Upcoming high-impact USD CPI data could increase volatility and potentially strengthen the USD if the actual exceeds forecast, affecting EUR/USD negatively. The correlation analysis shows a strong positive relationship with GBP/USD, suggesting movements in EUR/USD could be mirrored by GBP/USD. Considering all factors, including technical indicators, sentiment, and economic events, a cautious approach is warranted.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant bearish reversal patterns on H1 or H4, unexpected high USD CPI data, or a break below key support levels.
Partial Profit Taking: If entering a trade, consider taking partial profits at key resistance levels or at a predetermined percentage gain to manage risk effectively.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not met the target, indicating a need for adjustment in strategy or better alignment with market conditions and sentiment. It's crucial to analyze the reasons behind the losses, whether they were due to misinterpretation of signals, unexpected market news, or failure to adjust to changing market dynamics.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, adjusting the strategy weights to favor mean reversion slightly more could be beneficial in this period of high volatility and mixed signals. This adjustment would capitalize on short-term price movements back towards the mean, which could be more prevalent in the current market environment.
