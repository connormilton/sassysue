MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish bias in the short term, as indicated by the recent price action and technical indicators. The currency pair has been trading within a relatively tight range, with recent price action suggesting a potential for an upward move. The moving averages are indicating a bullish crossover potential, with the price above MA20 and MA50 on the H1 timeframe. The RSI is moderately bullish, and the MACD is close to crossing above its signal line, suggesting increasing bullish momentum. Intermarket correlations and recent economic events, such as the ECB Interest Rate Decision, seem to have been priced in, with upcoming USD CPI data potentially influencing future direction.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.13735
Stop Loss: 1.134
Take Profit Levels: [1.139, 1.1405, 1.142]
Risk Percent: 1%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a BUY position is based on the current bullish sentiment indicated by the price action closing above the key moving averages and the RSI and MACD showing signs of bullish momentum. The entry point is chosen based on the recent breakout above the 1.13700 resistance level, with the stop loss set below the recent low to protect against any sudden downward movements. The take profit levels are set at key resistance levels identified in the technical analysis, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe, a significant bearish news event, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take partial profits at each of the specified take profit levels, adjusting the stop loss to break-even after the first target is reached, and considering a trailing stop to protect profits as the price moves in our favor.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a need for tighter risk management and better alignment with market sentiment. The risk percentage per trade has been adjusted to 1% to reflect a more conservative approach during the strategy refinement period.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, an adjustment in strategy weights is warranted. Increasing the weight of the trend-following strategy to 0.5, reducing the breakout strategy to 0.3, and maintaining the mean reversion strategy at 0.2 could potentially align better with the observed market conditions.
