MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bearish sentiment with a 66% bearish market sentiment and a recent price action indicating a potential downward trend. The recent economic events, including the ECB Interest Rate Decision and Nonfarm Payrolls, have not significantly shifted the market sentiment. The upcoming CPI m/m data for the USD could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the actual figures exceed the forecast. The multi-timeframe analysis shows a consolidation phase with a slight bearish bias on the H1 and H4 timeframes, suggesting a potential breakout to the downside.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades have not achieved the desired outcome, indicating a potential misalignment with market sentiment or an incorrect interpretation of the technical analysis. The adjustment of the stop loss in the recent trade suggests an attempt at risk mitigation, but the overall strategy may need reevaluation.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of the trend-following strategy, it may be beneficial to adjust the strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on breakout and mean reversion strategies in periods of consolidation and unclear direction. This adjustment could allow for better capitalization on short-term volatility and market corrections.
