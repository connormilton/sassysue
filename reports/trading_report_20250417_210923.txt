MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a mix of bullish and bearish signals across different timeframes. The H1 and H4 timeframes indicate a consolidation phase with a slight bullish bias, as evidenced by the recent price action closing above the 20-period MA and the RSI being above 50. The daily timeframe shows a recent uptrend, supported by the ECB's steady interest rate and a slight decline in USD strength, as suggested by the nonfarm payroll data. Intermarket correlations reveal a positive relationship with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggesting EUR strength against USD could continue if these trends persist. However, market sentiment is currently bearish, and upcoming high-impact USD CPI data could introduce volatility.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A significant shift in market sentiment towards bullish for EUR/USD, or if the upcoming USD CPI data is significantly below forecasts, indicating weakness in the USD.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A since no new trade is recommended at this moment.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not capitalized on the market's volatility and directional moves effectively, indicating a need for better alignment with market sentiment and economic indicators. The win rate of 0% suggests a reevaluation of entry points and stop loss management.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, adjusting the strategy weights to increase focus on mean reversion strategies might be beneficial during periods of high volatility and uncertain direction. A possible adjustment could be trend_following: 0.3, breakout: 0.3, mean_reversion: 0.4.
