MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bullish trend in the short term, as indicated by the price being above both the MA_20 and MA_50 on the H1 timeframe. The RSI at 56.99 suggests a neutral to slightly bullish momentum, while the MACD above its signal line also supports the bullish bias. However, the market sentiment is bearish, with a 60% bearish outlook, which could indicate potential resistance to further upward movements. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. Intermarket correlations, particularly the strong positive correlation with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggest external factors could influence EUR/USD movements.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Exit early if the price breaks below the new stop loss level or if there's a significant bearish reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe. Additionally, a stronger than expected USD CPI data release could warrant an early exit to mitigate potential losses.
Partial Profit Taking: Given the current market conditions and the decision to wait for further clarity, no new partial profit-taking strategy is proposed at this moment. The focus is on managing the existing positions with an updated stop loss.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades have not yet concluded, indicating a need for patience and further observation of the market's reaction to upcoming economic events. The decision to wait and not open new positions reflects a cautious approach in a market showing mixed signals.
Strategy Adjustments: Considering the current market analysis and the bearish sentiment, it may be prudent to adjust strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on mean reversion in the short term, especially around significant economic releases that could introduce volatility.
