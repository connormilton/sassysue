MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a consolidation pattern on the H1 timeframe, with recent price action indicating a slight bearish sentiment but overall remaining neutral. The recent ECB interest rate decision and the upcoming CPI data for the USD could introduce volatility. The sentiment data shows a nearly balanced view among traders, with a slight bearish lean. The multi-timeframe analysis reveals a potential for both trend continuation and mean reversion, given the recent pullback from the highs on the daily timeframe and the consolidation on the lower timeframes.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: SELL
Entry Price: 1.13566
Stop Loss: 1.1375
Take Profit Levels: [1.134, 1.1325, 1.131]
Risk Percent: 2%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a SELL position is based on the failure to break above recent resistance levels and the anticipation of bearish momentum influenced by upcoming high-impact USD economic events. The entry range is chosen to optimize entry in the current consolidation phase, with a stop loss placed above recent highs to mitigate risk. The take profit levels are set at key psychological and technical support levels, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe or a break above the 1.13750 level indicating a false breakout.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 50% of the position off at the first take profit level (1.13400), 30% at the second level (1.13250), and let the remaining 20% run to the final target (1.13100) with a trailing stop to capitalize on potential extended moves.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a need to refine entry and exit points, particularly in managing stop loss levels more dynamically to protect against sudden market moves. The consolidation pattern was not fully capitalized on, suggesting a need for better recognition of such patterns and adjustment of strategy accordingly.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and recent performance, there's a need to balance between trend-following and mean-reversion strategies, possibly by allocating more weight to mean reversion in times of high consolidation and less clear trends.
