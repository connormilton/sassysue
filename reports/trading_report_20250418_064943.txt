MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing mixed signals across various timeframes. The H1 and M15 timeframes indicate a slight bullish momentum with prices hovering above the MA20 but facing resistance near the 1.1375-1.1380 area. The 4-hour and daily charts suggest a consolidation phase with potential for breakout. The recent ECB interest rate decision and upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. Intermarket correlations and sentiment analysis suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook for EUR/USD, with institutional bias leaning bearish. Given the current market conditions and the need for strict risk management, a cautious approach is warranted.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in upcoming USD CPI data from forecast, breaking below key support levels on H1 and H4 timeframes, or a shift in market sentiment to strongly bearish.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not met the target due to a lack of alignment with broader market sentiment and economic indicators. The strategy may have been overly reliant on technical indicators without adequately considering macroeconomic events and intermarket analysis.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the mixed results and current market conditions, adjusting the strategy weights to prioritize mean reversion strategies during periods of consolidation and to reduce exposure to trend following in markets lacking clear direction could improve performance. Additionally, incorporating more comprehensive intermarket analysis and economic event anticipation could enhance decision-making.
