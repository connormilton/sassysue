MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing a mixed sentiment with a bearish inclination as indicated by the market sentiment data. The technical indicators suggest a near-term bearish bias with the RSI below 50 and MACD below its signal line. However, the price is hovering around the MA20 and MA50, indicating potential for either direction. The recent economic events, including the ECB Interest Rate Decision and the upcoming USD CPI, could influence the pair's direction. The correlation analysis shows a strong relationship with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggesting that EUR/USD might be influenced by broader market trends and interest rate differentials.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: None
Partial Profit Taking: None

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades show a balanced approach between buy and sell positions, indicating an attempt to capitalize on market volatility. However, the lack of wins suggests a need for refinement in entry criteria and possibly better timing or improved stop-loss management.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and recent performance, it might be prudent to adjust the strategy weights slightly in favor of mean reversion (0.25) and reduce the weight on trend following (0.45) while keeping breakout strategy weight as is. This adjustment reflects the current market's indecision and potential for reversals.
