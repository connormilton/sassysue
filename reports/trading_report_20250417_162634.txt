MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a slight bearish sentiment in the market with a bearish percent of 59. The recent price action on the H1 timeframe indicates a potential for further downside, given the pair's failure to break above the 1.1386 resistance. The moving averages suggest a short-term bearish bias as the price is below the MA_20 but still above the MA_50, indicating a potential consolidation phase. The RSI at 41.24 suggests that the market is not yet in oversold territory, providing room for further downside. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility and potentially strengthen the USD if the actual figures exceed forecasts.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: SELL
Entry Price: 1.13566
Stop Loss: 1.1386
Take Profit Levels: [1.1335, 1.131, 1.1285]
Risk Percent: 2.0%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a SELL position is based on the bearish market sentiment, the technical setup indicating a potential reversal from the recent highs, and the anticipation of USD strength from the upcoming CPI data. The entry range is chosen to capitalize on the current price consolidation, with a stop loss placed above the recent high to mitigate risk. The take profit levels are set at key psychological and technical support levels, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe or a break above the 1.13860 level indicating a false breakout.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 50% of the position off at the first take profit level, 30% at the second, and let the remaining 20% run to the third take profit level or be stopped out by the trailing stop.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades indicate a need to refine entry and exit strategies, particularly in volatile market conditions. The analysis of past trades shows a tendency towards premature exits and entries, suggesting an improvement in timing and confirmation of trends could enhance performance.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, a slight adjustment towards favoring trend following strategies in the current market condition seems prudent. The weight on mean reversion strategies should be reduced in favor of breakout strategies, especially around key economic announcements.
