MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment across multiple timeframes, with a recent uptick in price on the H1 and M5 timeframes indicating potential for further gains. The moving averages on the H1 timeframe suggest a bullish crossover, with the price above both MA20 and MA50. The RSI is moderately bullish at 54.49, indicating some room before reaching overbought territory. The MACD is slightly below the signal line but close enough to suggest a potential bullish crossover. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the actual figures exceed forecasts. Intermarket correlations show a strong positive relationship with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggesting EUR strength against the USD may continue if these trends persist. The recent ECB interest rate decision to maintain rates at 4.00% has likely been priced in, with market sentiment remaining neutral to slightly bullish.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A significant deviation in the upcoming USD CPI data from forecasts, indicating stronger USD strength, or a reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: If a trade were to be placed, profits should be taken at key resistance levels, with the possibility of adjusting the take-profit levels based on market reaction to upcoming economic events.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not achieved the desired win rate, indicating a potential misalignment with current market conditions or an overestimation of the market's response to technical indicators. The risk management strategy effectively protected the account from significant losses, but the entry points may have been suboptimal.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, adjusting the strategy weights to prioritize mean reversion slightly more could be beneficial in this neutral to slightly bullish market sentiment. A potential adjustment could be trend_following: 0.35, breakout: 0.35, mean_reversion: 0.3. This adjustment reflects the current market's lack of strong directional momentum and the potential for gains from short-term reversals within the established range.
