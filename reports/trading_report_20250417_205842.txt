MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a mixed sentiment across different timeframes, with a slight bearish sentiment in market positioning and upcoming high-impact USD CPI data which might strengthen the USD if it exceeds forecasts. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish momentum with the price hovering around MA20 and MA50, and RSI in a neutral zone. The recent price action on H1 and H4 timeframes shows consolidation with a slight bearish bias from the recent highs. Considering the economic calendar, the upcoming USD CPI data could introduce significant volatility.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Exit early if the price breaks below the new stop loss level before the USD CPI announcement, indicating a stronger bearish sentiment. Additionally, exit if the price action shows a clear reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe or if there's a significant bearish news event.
Partial Profit Taking: Consider taking partial profits at the first take profit level (1.139) if the price moves favorably before the CPI data release. If the CPI data is in line or weaker than expected, hold for the second take profit level (1.1405), reassessing the position as the market reacts.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a trend-following bias, which might not have been fully aligned with the market's consolidation phase. This misalignment could explain the current 0% win rate out of 5 trades.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, it might be prudent to adjust the strategy weights to increase the mean reversion component to 0.3, decrease the trend following to 0.35, and maintain the breakout strategy at 0.35. This adjustment could better align with the current market phase of consolidation and potential for reversals around key economic announcements.
