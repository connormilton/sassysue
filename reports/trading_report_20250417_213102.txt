MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish bias in the market sentiment and technical indicators. The RSI at 59.13 suggests a mild bullish momentum, while the MACD is near the zero line, indicating a lack of strong momentum. The price is currently above both MA20 and MA50, which could be seen as a bullish signal. However, the recent price action shows a consolidation pattern, with the price oscillating within a tight range. The upcoming USD CPI data could be a significant market mover. Considering the correlations, EUR/USD has a positive correlation with GBP/USD and Gold, suggesting that movements in these markets could influence EUR/USD. The economic calendar shows high-impact events upcoming, which could increase market volatility.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in upcoming USD CPI data from the forecast, indicating stronger USD; a break below the key support level at 1.1340; or a reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a trend-following strategy with a focus on bullish momentum in EUR/USD. However, the win rate is currently at 0%, indicating a need for adjustment in either entry criteria, risk management, or both. The current market conditions suggest a consolidation phase with upcoming high-impact news events that could significantly affect the market direction.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and performance, it may be beneficial to adjust the strategy weights towards a more conservative approach until after the high-impact news events. Increasing the weight on mean reversion strategies could capitalize on the current consolidation phase of EUR/USD. Additionally, refining entry criteria to include a stronger confirmation of trend direction or breakout from consolidation could improve trade outcomes.
