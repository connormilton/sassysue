MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a mix of bullish and bearish signals across different timeframes. The recent price action on the H1 timeframe indicates a slight bullish momentum with the price closing above the 20-period MA and approaching the upper Bollinger Band. The RSI is moderately bullish at 54.49, suggesting some upward momentum. However, the MACD is nearly flat, indicating a lack of strong momentum. The 5-minute and 15-minute timeframes show a more volatile but generally upward trend in the very short term. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce significant volatility. Intermarket correlations and recent economic events suggest a cautious approach, given the neutral market sentiment and the potential for USD strength if CPI data exceeds expectations.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant price movement against the position following the USD CPI announcement, a close below the newly adjusted stop loss level, or a bearish reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: Should the market move favorably post-CPI announcement, consider taking partial profits at 1.1390 and adjusting the stop loss to break-even for the remaining position. Further profits could be taken at 1.1405, with the final target at 1.1420, depending on continued bullish momentum.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a need for more adaptive risk management, especially in anticipation of high-impact economic news. While the trend-following strategy remains predominant, the effectiveness of entry and exit points needs refinement to better capture market movements.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, adjusting the strategy weights to increase the emphasis on mean reversion to 0.3, while maintaining trend following and breakout strategies at 0.35 each, could provide a more balanced approach in the current market environment.
