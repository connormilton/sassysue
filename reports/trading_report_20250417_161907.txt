MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair has shown a slight bearish sentiment in recent trades, with the price action hovering below the 20-period MA on the H1 timeframe, indicating potential for further downside. The RSI at 41 suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, providing room for movement in either direction. The MACD is slightly below the signal line, hinting at bearish momentum. However, the upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. The multi-timeframe analysis shows a recent decline from highs, suggesting a potential mean reversion or continuation of the downtrend. Market sentiment is bearish, and recent economic events have not significantly shifted the fundamental outlook.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: SELL
Entry Price: 1.135
Stop Loss: 1.1375
Take Profit Levels: [1.133, 1.131, 1.129]
Risk Percent: 2.0%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: Given the bearish market sentiment, the pair's failure to maintain gains above the 20-period MA, and the anticipation of USD strength from the upcoming CPI data, a SELL position aligns with a trend-following strategy. The entry range is chosen to capitalize on current market consolidation, with a stop loss placed above recent highs to mitigate risk. The take profit levels are set at key psychological and technical support levels, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe or a break above the 1.13750 level indicating a false breakout.
Partial Profit Taking: Take partial profits at each target level, moving the stop loss to break-even after the first target is reached to ensure a risk-free trade thereafter.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a mix of outcomes, highlighting the need for adaptability in strategy application based on market conditions. The success of mean reversion strategies in certain conditions suggests the importance of timing and market sentiment in trade execution.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, increasing the weight on trend-following strategies may be prudent, especially in times of clear market sentiment and directional momentum. Mean reversion strategies should be applied cautiously, considering the broader market context and upcoming economic events.
