MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a slight bullish trend on the H1 timeframe, with recent prices hovering above the MA_20 and MA_50, indicating potential for further upside. The RSI at 63 suggests the market is not yet overbought, providing room for upward movement. However, market sentiment is bearish, with a higher percentage of market participants expecting a decline. This sentiment, coupled with upcoming high-impact USD CPI data, could introduce volatility. Intermarket correlations show a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggesting EUR strength against USD weakness when the spread widens. The recent ECB interest rate decision to maintain rates at 4.00% may have already been priced in, leaving the upcoming CPI data as the next significant market mover.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in USD CPI data from forecasts, indicating stronger USD; reversal patterns on H1 or H4 timeframes; breaking below key support levels.
Partial Profit Taking: If a trade were to be placed, taking partial profits at key resistance levels while adjusting the stop loss to break-even or using a trailing stop to protect gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not met the target due to market volatility and perhaps an overreliance on trend-following strategies without adequately accounting for market sentiment and upcoming economic events. The current bearish market sentiment towards EUR/USD was not fully considered.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed signals from technical indicators and market sentiment, it would be prudent to adjust strategy weights to place more emphasis on mean reversion and breakout strategies, especially around key economic releases. This adjustment would better align with the expected market volatility and potential for sharp price movements.
