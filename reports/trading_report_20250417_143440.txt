MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bearish trend on the H1 timeframe with lower highs and lower lows, indicating potential for further downside. The 4-hour and daily charts suggest a consolidation phase with a slight bearish bias given the recent failure to break higher resistance levels. Economic events, particularly the upcoming USD CPI, could introduce volatility. Market sentiment is bullish, but institutional bias is bearish, suggesting mixed signals. Given the recent SELL trade's rationale and current market conditions, a cautious approach is warranted.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: UPDATE
New Stop Loss: 1.1365
Reason: Tightening the stop loss due to the consolidation pattern on the H1 timeframe and to protect against potential upside volatility from upcoming economic events. This adjustment also aligns with the bearish institutional bias and the current market structure, aiming to reduce exposure while still allowing room for the trade to develop.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Exit the trade early if the price breaks above 1.1370, indicating a potential reversal or if there is unexpected bullish news from the upcoming USD CPI event.
Partial Profit Taking: Take partial profits at 1.1340 (50% of the position) and move the stop loss to break-even for the remaining position. The second take-profit level at 1.1320 remains unchanged for the rest of the position, aiming to capitalize on potential extended downward movement while securing some gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent SELL trade reflects a well-justified trend-following approach given the resistance level rejections. However, the market's mixed signals and upcoming economic events suggest a need for tighter risk management and more flexible exit strategies.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and mixed sentiment, adjusting the strategy weights to equally value trend following, breakout, and mean reversion strategies could provide a more balanced approach. This adjustment would allow for better adaptation to the market's consolidation phases and potential breakout or reversal scenarios.
