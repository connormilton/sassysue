MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a consistent bullish trend across multiple timeframes, with recent price action hovering around key resistance levels. The moving averages indicate a bullish sentiment, with the price above MA20 and MA50 on the H1 timeframe. The RSI is moderately bullish, and the MACD histogram indicates increasing bullish momentum. Intermarket correlations suggest a neutral to slightly bullish outlook for EUR/USD, given its positive correlation with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, which could indicate a weakening USD or strengthening EUR. The economic calendar shows upcoming CPI data for the USD, which could introduce volatility. Considering the recent trades and the current market sentiment, which is evenly split between bullish and bearish, the market conditions seem ripe for a cautious bullish strategy.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.1374
Stop Loss: 1.136
Take Profit Levels: [1.139, 1.1405, 1.142]
Risk Percent: 2%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a BUY position is based on the bullish trend confirmed by moving averages, RSI, and MACD indicators across multiple timeframes. The entry point is chosen based on the recent consolidation pattern near the 1.1374 level, providing a favorable risk-reward ratio with a stop loss set below the recent low to protect against short-term reversals. The take profit levels are aligned with key resistance levels identified in the technical analysis.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 or H4 timeframe, significant bearish news event, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 50% of the position off at the first take profit level (1.1390), move the stop loss to break even. Take an additional 25% off at the second level (1.1405), and let the remaining 25% run to the final target (1.1420) or until the trailing stop is hit.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a preference for trend-following strategies, which have been moderately successful. The market's current conditions have validated this approach, but there's a need to closely monitor economic events and market sentiment to adjust strategies accordingly.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, maintaining an equal weight on trend-following, breakout, and mean reversion strategies seems appropriate. However, a slight bias towards trend-following could be beneficial in the current market environment, as long as it's coupled with rigorous risk management.
