MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing a bearish sentiment with a majority of market participants positioned for further downside. Technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook; the RSI is near the middle range, indicating no clear overbought or oversold conditions, while the MACD is slightly negative but close to a bullish crossover. The price is hovering around the MA20 and MA50, suggesting a potential for either direction. The recent economic events, including the ECB's interest rate decision and the US Nonfarm Payrolls, have not significantly shifted market sentiment. Upcoming events like the US CPI could introduce volatility. Intermarket correlations show a moderate relationship with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggesting EUR/USD might be influenced by broader USD movements and interest rate differentials.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a balanced approach between trend following and mean reversion strategies. However, the market's current state suggests a need for a more nuanced approach, especially considering the mixed technical signals and upcoming economic events.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, it might be prudent to adjust the strategy weights slightly in favor of mean reversion (0.25) while slightly reducing the weight on trend following (0.45) and maintaining breakout strategy weight (0.3). This adjustment reflects the current market's indecision and the potential for sharp, short-term reversals around key economic announcements.
