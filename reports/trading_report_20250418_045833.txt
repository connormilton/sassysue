MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bullish sentiment in the recent H1 and H4 timeframes, with prices oscillating around key moving averages. The recent ECB interest rate decision and the upcoming USD CPI event are likely to influence market volatility. Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD signal bullish momentum, yet market sentiment appears bearish, suggesting potential upcoming resistance. Intermarket correlations indicate a mixed influence on EUR/USD, with a notable bearish sentiment from market participants.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in USD CPI data from forecasts, indicating stronger USD; a bearish reversal pattern on H1 or H4 timeframe; breaking below the newly adjusted stop loss level.
Partial Profit Taking: Should the market move in our favor, consider taking partial profits at 1.1390 and moving the stop loss to break-even. Further profits could be taken at 1.1405, with the final target at 1.1420, adjusting the stop loss upwards to protect gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent BUY trades indicate an optimistic outlook based on trend-following strategies. However, the bearish market sentiment and mixed success of these trades suggest a need for more cautious entry points and tighter risk management.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and recent trade performance, it may be prudent to adjust strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on mean reversion in anticipation of potential market corrections, especially in the face of high-impact economic news.
