MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing mixed signals across different timeframes. The recent price action on the H1 timeframe shows a slight downtrend, with the price moving below the MA20 but still above the MA50, indicating a potential for both trend continuation and reversal. The RSI at 38 suggests the market is nearing oversold conditions, which could lead to a potential bounce. The MACD is below the signal line, indicating bearish momentum, but the proximity suggests a potential reversal if bullish momentum picks up. The upcoming USD CPI data could significantly impact the pair, potentially strengthening the USD if the data exceeds expectations. Intermarket correlations show a strong relationship with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggesting movements in these markets could influence EUR/USD. The market sentiment is neutral with a slight bearish inclination among institutional biases.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.13566
Stop Loss: 1.134
Take Profit Levels: [1.1375, 1.139, 1.141]
Risk Percent: 2%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: Considering the near oversold conditions on the RSI, the price being above MA50, and the potential for a bullish reversal indicated by the MACD nearing a crossover, a BUY position is recommended. The entry range is set to capitalize on the current market sentiment and technical setup, with a stop loss placed below the recent lows to mitigate risk. The take profit levels are set at key psychological levels and near previous resistance levels, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe, a significant bearish news event, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take partial profits at each take profit level, moving the stop loss to break even after the first target is reached, and then to each subsequent target level as the price moves in favor.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades show a balanced approach between BUY and SELL positions, indicating adaptability to market conditions. The use of trailing stops and staged profit-taking aligns with risk management principles. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in achieving the 10% daily return goal remains to be seen, requiring further analysis and adjustment based on market response.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and mixed signals, maintaining equal weights on trend following, breakout, and mean reversion strategies seems appropriate. However, increased emphasis on real-time economic data and intermarket analysis could enhance decision-making.
