MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing mixed signals across different timeframes. The recent price action on the H1 and M15 timeframes suggests a consolidation phase, with prices oscillating within a narrow range. The technical indicators such as the RSI being below 50 and the MACD histogram showing a slight bearish momentum indicate potential for further downside. However, the price is currently near the MA50, suggesting some level of support. The daily timeframe shows a recent uptrend, but with resistance levels not far above the current price, indicating potential for a pullback or consolidation. Intermarket correlations and recent economic events suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook for EUR/USD, considering the bearish market sentiment and the upcoming high-impact USD CPI data.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: An unexpected bullish breakout above 1.1370 or a significant bearish move below 1.1330.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a need for better alignment with market sentiment and economic events. The mixed success of trend-following strategies suggests a need for more nuanced entry points and better-defined exit strategies.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, there's a need to adjust the strategy weights slightly towards mean reversion and breakout strategies, considering the consolidation patterns and potential for sharp moves following economic announcements. Adjusting the weights to trend_following: 0.4, breakout: 0.35, mean_reversion: 0.25 could provide a better balance.
