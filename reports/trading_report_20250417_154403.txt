MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a mixed sentiment with a slight bullish inclination in the recent market sentiment data. The technical indicators suggest a potential for mean reversion, given the RSI is below the oversold threshold, and the price is currently below the MA20 but above MA50, indicating a possible upward correction. The recent economic events, including the ECB Interest Rate Decision, have maintained status quo, potentially stabilizing the EUR. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. Intermarket correlations and recent trades suggest a cautious approach, balancing between mean reversion and trend following strategies.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A break below the updated stop loss level or a significant bearish reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe. Additionally, if the upcoming USD CPI data significantly beats expectations, it might warrant an early exit to mitigate potential losses.
Partial Profit Taking: Consider taking partial profits at the first take profit level (1.13800) to secure gains and adjust the stop loss to break-even for the remaining position. Subsequent profit-taking can follow the original plan, adjusting stops upwards in line with the trailing stop distance as the market moves in favor.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a need for refinement in entry points and stop loss placements, considering the market's volatility and economic events. The mixed success suggests that while the strategy direction is generally aligned with market conditions, timing and risk management could be improved.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, there's a need to balance between mean reversion and trend following strategies more effectively. Adjusting strategy weights to give slightly more emphasis to mean reversion in the short term may capitalize on the current market conditions. However, maintaining flexibility to switch back to trend following should the market sentiment strongly shift post-economic announcements.
