MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a bullish sentiment across multiple timeframes, with the recent price action hovering above the 20-period moving average on the H1 timeframe, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. The RSI at 63 suggests a strong momentum without being overbought. The MACD above its signal line further supports the bullish outlook. Intermarket correlations, especially the positive correlation with GBP/USD and gold, align with a weaker USD scenario. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the actual figure exceeds forecasts. Considering these factors, the current market condition favors a cautious bullish approach.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Exit early if the price breaks below the newly adjusted stop loss at 1.13692, indicating a short-term reversal. Additionally, exit if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, suggesting a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take partial profits at 1.139, 1.1405, and 1.142, aligning with key resistance levels. Consider tightening the trailing stop to secure profits as the price moves favorably.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a bullish bias in line with the market sentiment and technical indicators. However, the outcomes are yet to be determined, highlighting the importance of risk management and the need to adapt to market conditions swiftly, especially ahead of high-impact economic releases.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis and recent trade performance, it's advisable to maintain a balanced approach between trend following and mean reversion strategies while being cautious with breakout strategies, especially during times of expected high volatility around economic announcements. Adjusting strategy weights to trend_following: 0.7, breakout: 1.2, mean_reversion: 1.1 could better align with the current market conditions.
