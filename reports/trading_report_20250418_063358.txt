MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment across multiple timeframes, with a recent uptrend observed in the 1-hour and 4-hour charts. Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD support this bullish trend, although the proximity to key resistance levels suggests potential for pullbacks. Intermarket correlations, particularly with GBP/USD and gold, indicate a mixed impact on EUR/USD, while upcoming economic events, especially the USD CPI, could introduce volatility. The sentiment analysis shows a slight bullish bias among institutional investors, which aligns with the current trend-following strategy.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant reversal patterns on H1/H4, unexpected high USD CPI data, or breaking below key support levels.
Partial Profit Taking: Consider taking partial profits at 1.139 and adjust trailing stop to entry after reaching the first target. Monitor closely for signs of reversal or stagnation near resistance levels.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a preference for trend-following strategies, which aligns with the current market condition. However, the win rate has been low due to either premature entries or not accounting for economic event volatility. Adjusting entry criteria and being more selective with setups could improve performance.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, maintaining a balance between trend-following and breakout strategies seems appropriate. However, increasing the weight on mean reversion could be beneficial in capturing profits from potential pullbacks after reaching key resistance levels.
