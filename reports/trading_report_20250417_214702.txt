MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment in the short term, with the price action hovering around key moving averages on the H1 timeframe, indicating potential for upward movement. The recent economic events, including the ECB Interest Rate Decision, have maintained status quo, likely causing limited immediate impact on EUR strength. However, upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. Technical indicators suggest a cautious bullish momentum with RSI above 50 but not in overbought territory, and MACD showing a slight bullish crossover. Intermarket correlations reveal a strong relationship with GBP/USD, which is currently bullish, potentially supporting EUR strength. The market sentiment is neutral, with a slight bearish bias from institutional positioning, suggesting mixed market views.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A significant bearish reversal pattern on the H1 or 15-minute timeframes, or if the upcoming USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD, which could negatively impact the EUR/USD pair.
Partial Profit Taking: Consider taking partial profits at the first take profit level (1.139) to lock in gains and adjust the stop loss to break-even for the remaining position. Further profits could be taken at the second level (1.1405), with the option to let the remaining portion of the trade run with a trailing stop to capture any extended upward movement.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a trend-following bias with an emphasis on bullish positions. The win rate has been low, indicating potential misalignment with market conditions or timing issues in entry/exit points. The risk management has been effective in keeping losses within acceptable limits.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis and recent performance, adjusting the strategy weights to increase focus on mean reversion strategies during periods of high market volatility and uncertainty could improve outcomes. Incorporating more dynamic entry and exit points based on real-time market sentiment and economic event outcomes could also enhance trade performance.
