MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bullish sentiment in the recent market data, with technical indicators supporting a continued uptrend. The RSI at 63.01 suggests a strong momentum without being overbought. The MACD is above its signal line, indicating bullish momentum. The price is currently above both MA20 and MA50, further supporting the bullish outlook. Multi-timeframe analysis shows a consistent bullish pattern, especially in the H1 and M5 timeframes, with recent price action forming a consolidation pattern around the 1.1372-1.1374 range, suggesting a potential breakout. Intermarket correlations and recent economic events, such as the ECB's interest rate decision, seem to have been priced in, with the market maintaining its bullish stance. The upcoming USD CPI could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the actual exceeds forecasts, which needs to be monitored closely.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A significant bearish reversal pattern on the H1 or H4 timeframe, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD. Additionally, a break below the newly adjusted stop loss level would also trigger an exit.
Partial Profit Taking: Take partial profits at 1.139, 1.1405, and 1.142, corresponding to key resistance levels. Consider tightening the trailing stop to 0.0015 once the first take profit level is reached to secure profits while allowing for further upside.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have leveraged bullish momentum in EUR/USD, aligning with the overall market sentiment and technical indicators. However, the win rate has been impacted by not adjusting stop losses according to the latest market conditions and potentially entering trades without considering upcoming high-impact economic events.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the performance of recent trades, there's a need to adjust strategy weights slightly. Increasing the weight on trend-following strategies to 0.7, given the current bullish trend in EUR/USD, while slightly reducing the weight on breakout strategies to 1.3 and maintaining mean reversion at 1.0. This adjustment reflects the current market dynamics and the importance of following the trend in a strongly directional market.
