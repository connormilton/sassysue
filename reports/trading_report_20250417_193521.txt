MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bearish trend in the recent H1 and H4 timeframes, with the price currently below the MA20 but above the MA50, indicating potential for short-term consolidation or reversal. The RSI at 43.64 suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, providing room for movement in either direction. The MACD is slightly below the signal line, indicating bearish momentum, but the proximity suggests a potential crossover. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. The sentiment analysis shows a bullish bias among traders, which might support a reversal or upward movement. Intermarket correlations, especially the negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggest that EUR/USD could be influenced by changes in yield differentials.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a balanced approach between trend-following and anticipation of market reversals. The success of these trades would depend on the accuracy of the technical analysis and the impact of economic events. It's crucial to analyze the outcome of these trades to refine entry and exit strategies, especially in response to high-impact news events.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, it might be beneficial to adjust the strategy weights slightly towards mean reversion (0.25) while slightly reducing the weight on trend following (0.45) and breakout (0.3). This adjustment reflects the current market's tendency for consolidation and potential for sharp reversals around key economic announcements.
