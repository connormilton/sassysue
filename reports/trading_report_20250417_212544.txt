MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a slight bullish momentum on the H1 timeframe, with the price recently closing above the MA20 and MA50, indicating a potential uptrend continuation. The RSI at 59 suggests the market is not yet overbought, providing room for upward movement. However, the MACD is close to the signal line, indicating a cautious approach is necessary. The recent price action on the 5-minute and 15-minute timeframes shows consolidation with a slight bullish bias, as indicated by the latest closes near the upper end of the recent range. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, suggesting a cautious approach. Intermarket correlations and recent economic events suggest a mixed influence on EUR/USD, with the ECB's steady interest rate decision providing some support for the euro, while the upcoming CPI data could strengthen the USD if it exceeds forecasts.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A significant bearish reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe, a breakout below key support levels, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a bullish bias, but the win rate is currently 0%, indicating a need for better timing or confirmation before entry. The market's reaction to economic events and sentiment should be weighed more heavily in decision-making.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and performance, adjusting the strategy weights to increase emphasis on mean reversion could be beneficial during periods of consolidation and uncertainty, reducing the weight on trend following until a clearer direction is established post-economic announcements.
