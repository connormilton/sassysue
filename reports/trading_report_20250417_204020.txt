MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bullish sentiment in recent price action, with the price closing above key moving averages and the RSI indicating positive momentum. The currency pair's movement is also supported by high market volume, suggesting strong interest in the bullish direction. However, upcoming high-impact USD CPI data could introduce volatility. Intermarket correlations, particularly with GBP/USD and Gold, suggest a broader market trend that could influence EUR/USD. The technical setup, combined with a bullish market sentiment and the anticipation of economic events, presents a potential opportunity for a long position, albeit with caution due to possible volatility from upcoming economic data.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant bearish reversal patterns on the H1 timeframe, unexpected high-impact news that negatively affects the EUR, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take partial profits at the first take profit level to secure gains and adjust the stop loss to break-even for the remaining position. Monitor market reaction to economic events closely and be prepared to adjust take profit levels or close the position early to protect profits.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a trend-following bias, which has not capitalized on market reversals or breakout opportunities as effectively. The win rate is currently at 0%, indicating a need for strategy refinement, particularly in entry timing and risk management.
Strategy Adjustments: Increase the weight of the mean reversion strategy to 0.3 and adjust the trend following and breakout strategies to 0.35 each. This adjustment aims to better capture opportunities in volatile or reversing markets, especially around high-impact news events.
