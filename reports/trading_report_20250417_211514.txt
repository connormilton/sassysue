MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a slight bullish trend on the H1 timeframe, with the price currently above both the MA20 and MA50, indicating a potential for continued upward movement. The RSI at 59 suggests the market is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further price action in either direction. However, the MACD is very close to the signal line, indicating a lack of strong momentum. The ATR indicates moderate market volatility, suitable for dynamic stop-loss adjustments. Considering the bearish market sentiment and upcoming high-impact USD CPI data, caution is advised. Intermarket correlations show a strong relationship with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggesting EUR strength may be tempered by broader USD movements.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant bearish reversal patterns on the H1 timeframe, unexpected high USD CPI data indicating stronger USD, or breaking below the new stop loss level.
Partial Profit Taking: Consider taking partial profits at the first take profit level (1.139) if the price action shows signs of stalling or reversing before reaching the target, especially in light of the upcoming economic events.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not capitalized on market movements as expected, indicating a potential misalignment between strategy execution and market conditions. The win rate is currently 0%, suggesting a need for strategy reevaluation, particularly in terms of entry timing and risk management.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, adjusting strategy weights to place a higher emphasis on mean reversion strategies might be beneficial in the current market phase, considering the mixed signals and upcoming economic events. A more cautious approach with tighter stop losses and a readiness to take profits earlier could improve trade outcomes.
