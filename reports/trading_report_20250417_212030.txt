MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bullish sentiment in the recent price action, with the pair closing above key moving averages and the RSI indicating positive momentum. The MACD is slightly bearish but close to crossing above its signal line, suggesting potential upward momentum. The ATR indicates moderate market volatility, suitable for dynamic stop-loss adjustments. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, suggesting a cautious approach. Intermarket correlations show a strong relationship with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, indicating potential EUR strength against USD if the spread widens. The recent ECB rate decision and Nonfarm Payrolls have been priced in, with the market now focusing on upcoming CPI data.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in upcoming USD CPI data from forecast, indicating stronger USD; reversal patterns on H1 or H4 timeframes; breaking below key support levels.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not yielded a positive win rate, suggesting a reassessment of entry criteria and risk management. The use of dynamic trailing stops based on ATR could be more effectively utilized to protect profits and reduce losses.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of trend-following strategies, an increased weight on mean reversion strategies might be warranted. This adjustment could capitalize on short-term price fluctuations within the established trading range.
