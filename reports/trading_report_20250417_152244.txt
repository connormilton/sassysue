MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing signs of consolidation with a slight bullish sentiment as indicated by the market sentiment data (bullish_percent: 66). The pair is trading below the MA_20 but above the MA_50, suggesting a potential for mean reversion within the context of a broader uptrend. The RSI at 35.85 hints at a market that is not yet overbought, providing room for upward movement. The recent price action on the H1 and M15 timeframes shows a struggle to break higher, with a notable spike in the last 5-minute candle to 1.13768, which could indicate a short-term bullish momentum. Given the upcoming high-impact USD CPI data, volatility is expected to increase, which could provide trading opportunities.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.137
Stop Loss: 1.135
Take Profit Levels: [1.1385, 1.14, 1.142]
Risk Percent: 2.0%
Strategy: mean_reversion
Reasoning: The decision to enter a BUY position is based on the bullish market sentiment, the pair's position relative to moving averages suggesting a mean reversion opportunity, and the anticipation of volatility from upcoming economic events which could favor EUR strength or USD weakness. The entry is set just above the recent consolidation to capture upward momentum, with a stop loss placed below the recent low to mitigate risk. Take profit levels are set at near-term resistance levels, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A break below 1.13500 or a significant bearish reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 50% of the position off at the first take profit level, 25% at the second, and let the remaining 25% run with a trailing stop to maximize potential gains while protecting profits.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a need for tighter risk management and more adaptive entry strategies to capture market volatility. The use of trailing stops has been effective in protecting profits but requires fine-tuning based on market conditions.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and recent performance, there's a need to balance between trend-following and mean-reversion strategies, with a slight increase in emphasis on mean reversion in markets showing consolidation patterns.
