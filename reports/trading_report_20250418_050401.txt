MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bullish trend in the recent H1 and H4 timeframes, with the price currently hovering above both the MA_20 and MA_50, indicating a potential continuation of the bullish momentum. The RSI at 56.99 suggests the market is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for upward movement. The MACD is above its signal line, further supporting the bullish sentiment. However, market sentiment is bearish, with a 66% bearish outlook from traders, which could indicate potential resistance to further upward movements. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the actual figures exceed forecasts. Considering the technical indicators, current market sentiment, and upcoming economic events, a cautious approach is recommended.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant bearish reversal patterns on the H1 or H4 timeframes, a stronger than expected USD CPI report indicating a potential USD strength, or a break below the newly adjusted stop loss level.
Partial Profit Taking: Given the current market conditions and the bearish sentiment, it's prudent to consider taking partial profits earlier than initially planned. If the trade moves in our favor, consider taking partial profits at 1.1385, which is before the first take profit level, to secure gains in a volatile market environment.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a bullish bias based on technical analysis, which has not fully accounted for bearish market sentiment and potential economic event impacts. This mismatch highlights the need for a more balanced approach that considers both technical indicators and market sentiment, especially in the face of significant upcoming economic data.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, adjusting the strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on market sentiment and economic indicators could improve decision-making. This adjustment would help in aligning the trading strategy more closely with prevailing market conditions and potentially enhance the accuracy of trade entries and exits.
