MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bullish sentiment in the market, supported by the recent price action closing above key moving averages (MA20, MA50, MA100) and a positive RSI indicating momentum. The MACD is slightly negative but close to the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish crossover. The ATR indicates moderate volatility, suitable for dynamic stop-loss adjustments. Intermarket correlations show a strong positive relationship with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US/DE yield spread, suggesting EUR strength against USD could continue if these trends persist. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, warranting cautious trade management.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Exit early if the price breaks below the newly adjusted stop loss before the USD CPI data release, indicating unexpected USD strength or if there's a bearish reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: If the trade moves into profit, take partial profits at 1.1390 and adjust the stop loss to break even. Further profits can be taken at 1.1405 and 1.1420, with the trailing stop ensuring protection of gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a bullish bias in line with market sentiment but faced challenges in timing and volatility around economic releases. The win rate is currently at 0%, indicating a need for better alignment with market conditions and improved risk management.
Strategy Adjustments: Increase emphasis on mean reversion strategies to 0.5 and reduce trend following to 0.2 to better capture potential reversals and reduce exposure during high volatility periods. Incorporate more stringent conditions for trade entries around major economic announcements.
