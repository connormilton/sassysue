MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing mixed signals across different timeframes. The recent price action suggests a slight bearish bias with the pair trading below the MA_20 but above the MA_50, indicating potential for both trend continuation and mean reversion. The RSI at 35.85 suggests the market is nearing oversold conditions, which might attract buyers. However, the MACD below its signal line suggests bearish momentum. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. The market sentiment is bullish, but institutional bias is bearish, presenting a conflicting view. Intermarket correlations show a strong positive correlation with GBP/USD and a negative correlation with the US_DE yield spread, suggesting EUR/USD might be influenced by broader USD movements and yield differentials.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A break below the new stop loss level at 1.13500 or an unexpected bearish reaction to the USD CPI data could warrant an early exit. Additionally, if the EUR/USD fails to show bullish momentum despite oversold conditions, reconsidering the position's viability is advised.
Partial Profit Taking: Given the current market conditions, it's prudent to monitor the trade closely and consider taking partial profits at key resistance levels or if the price action suggests a reversal. This approach will help lock in gains incrementally while assessing the market's response to economic events and technical indicators.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades indicate a need for more precise entry points and better alignment with market sentiment and economic events. The mixed success of trend-following and mean reversion strategies suggests a need for a more adaptive approach, particularly in markets showing conflicting signals.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current analysis, adjusting the strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on economic event outcomes and market sentiment may improve performance. Incorporating a more dynamic risk management approach that adapts to volatility and market conditions could also enhance outcomes.
