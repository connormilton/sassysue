MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair has shown a trend of slight bearishness in the recent price action, with the price currently below the MA20 but above the MA50, indicating a potential for mean reversion. The RSI at 35.85 suggests the pair is nearing oversold territory, which might attract buying interest. The MACD below its signal line also supports the bearish momentum in the short term. However, the upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. The market sentiment is bearish, with a higher percentage of bearish participants. Considering the multi-timeframe analysis, the pair has shown resilience at higher support levels, suggesting a potential for a bounce back if bullish catalysts emerge.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.136
Stop Loss: 1.134
Take Profit Levels: [1.138, 1.14, 1.142]
Risk Percent: 2.0%
Strategy: mean_reversion
Reasoning: The decision to enter a BUY position is based on the current oversold conditions indicated by the RSI, the pair's positioning relative to key moving averages, and anticipation of volatility from the upcoming USD CPI data. The entry is chosen to capture potential upside from a mean reversion, with a stop loss placed below recent lows to mitigate risk. Take profit levels are set at key resistance levels, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A break below 1.13400 or a significant bearish reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 30% of the position off at the first take profit level, 40% at the second, and let the remaining 30% run with a trailing stop to maximize gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a lack of success, indicating a potential misalignment between strategy application and market conditions. The failure to achieve the daily profit target suggests the need for a more nuanced approach to entry points and risk management.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, adjusting the strategy weights to give equal importance to mean reversion and trend following could be beneficial. The market conditions suggest that mean reversion might offer short-term opportunities, especially around key economic announcements.
