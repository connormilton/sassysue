MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair is currently showing mixed signals across various timeframes. The recent price action on the H1 timeframe indicates a slight bullish momentum with the latest close at 1.13735, above the MA20 and MA50, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, market sentiment is bearish, with a significant percentage of traders expecting the price to fall. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the actual figures exceed the forecast. Intermarket correlations show a strong relationship with GBP/USD, which could provide additional clues to EUR/USD's direction. Given the recent ECB rate decision and the upcoming economic events, caution is warranted.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Exit the trade early if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD, or if there's a bearish reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe. Additionally, consider exiting if the EUR/USD price breaks below the updated stop loss level of 1.1355.
Partial Profit Taking: Given the current market conditions and the bearish sentiment, it's prudent to take profits more conservatively. If the trade moves in our favor, consider taking partial profits at 1.1390 (first take profit level) and then reassess the market conditions before proceeding to the next levels. Adjust the trailing stop to just below the new support levels as the price moves up to secure profits.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades have not performed as expected, with a current win rate of 0%. This suggests that the market conditions might not be fully aligned with the strategies employed, or the entry/exit points and risk management settings need refinement.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis and the mixed success of recent trades, it might be beneficial to adjust the strategy weights to favor mean reversion slightly more, considering the upcoming market volatility and economic events. Adjusting the weights to trend_following: 0.35, breakout: 0.35, mean_reversion: 0.3 could provide a more balanced approach.
