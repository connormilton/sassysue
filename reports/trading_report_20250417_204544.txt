MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing a bullish sentiment in the market, with the price action closing above key moving averages on the H1 timeframe and the RSI and MACD indicating bullish momentum. The recent price action on the 5-minute and 15-minute timeframes supports a bullish breakout pattern, suggesting potential for further upside. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, and the current bullish market sentiment and high trading volume provide a favorable environment for a long position. Intermarket correlations, especially the positive correlation with GBP/USD and the negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggest external factors may also support EUR strength against the USD.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.1375
Stop Loss: 1.1345
Take Profit Levels: [1.139, 1.1405, 1.142]
Risk Percent: 1%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a BUY position is based on the bullish sentiment reflected in the market analysis, technical indicators, and positive correlations with other markets. The entry point is chosen to capitalize on the current momentum, with a stop loss placed to mitigate risk while allowing room for the trade to breathe. The take profit levels are set at key resistance levels, with a trailing stop to protect gains as the price moves favorably.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe, a significant bearish news event, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 50% of the position off at the first take profit level (1.1390), move the stop loss to break-even, then take 25% off at the second level (1.1405), and let the remaining 25% run with a trailing stop to capture any extended move.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a trend-following bias without significant wins, indicating a need for better timing or more effective use of trailing stops to lock in profits. The market conditions have been volatile, which suggests that the strategy could benefit from more dynamic entry and exit points.
Strategy Adjustments: Considering the current market analysis, increasing the weight on trend-following strategies seems justified, but there should also be an openness to incorporate mean-reversion strategies in case of sudden market turns. Adjusting the strategy weights to trend_following: 0.5, breakout: 0.3, mean_reversion: 0.2 could provide a more balanced approach.
