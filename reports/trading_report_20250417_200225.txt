MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bullish trend on the H1 timeframe, with the price moving above the MA20 and MA50, indicating potential for further upside. The RSI at 54.49 suggests the market is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for price movement in either direction. The MACD is close to signaling a bullish crossover, which could indicate an upcoming positive momentum. The recent price action on the 5-minute and 15-minute timeframes shows a consolidation pattern, with a breakout above 1.137, suggesting a continuation of the bullish trend. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, and the current bearish market sentiment might provide a contrarian bullish opportunity. Intermarket correlations and recent economic events suggest a cautious approach, with the ECB's steady interest rate decision potentially supporting the EUR.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.13735
Stop Loss: 1.1343
Take Profit Levels: [1.139, 1.1405, 1.142]
Risk Percent: 2%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a BUY position is based on the bullish breakout pattern observed on the 5-minute and 15-minute timeframes, supported by the positive momentum indicated by the MACD on the H1 timeframe. The entry is chosen at the recent breakout level, with a stop loss placed below the recent swing low to mitigate risk. The take profit levels are set at key psychological and technical resistance levels, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe, a significant bearish news event, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 30% of the position off at each take profit level, moving the stop loss to break-even after the first target is reached, and then to each subsequent take profit level as the price moves in our favor.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a mix of outcomes, indicating a need for better alignment with market sentiment and economic events. The use of trailing stops could be optimized based on volatility indicators like ATR to better protect profits and reduce losses.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and performance, increasing the weight on trend following strategies to 0.6, while reducing breakout to 0.25 and mean reversion to 0.15, could align better with the observed market patterns.
