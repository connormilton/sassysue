MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bullish sentiment in the recent price action, with the price moving above the MA20 and MA50, indicating a potential upward trend. The RSI at 58.77 suggests that the market is not yet in overbought territory, providing room for further upside. The MACD is above its signal line, reinforcing the bullish momentum. The recent economic events, such as the ECB Interest Rate Decision, have not introduced volatility that significantly deviates from current trends. The upcoming USD CPI could introduce volatility; however, the market sentiment remains bullish. The correlation analysis suggests EUR/USD has a positive relationship with GBP/USD and Gold, both of which are currently showing strength, potentially supporting further EUR/USD gains.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.1375
Stop Loss: 1.136
Take Profit Levels: [1.139, 1.1405, 1.142]
Risk Percent: 2%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a BUY position is based on the bullish trend confirmed by moving averages, RSI, and MACD indicators across multiple timeframes. The entry point is chosen based on the recent consolidation pattern near the 1.1375 level, providing a favorable risk-reward ratio with a stop loss set below the recent low to protect against short-term reversals. The take profit levels are aligned with key resistance levels identified in the technical analysis.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 or H4 timeframe, significant bearish news event, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 33% of the position off at each take profit level, moving the stop loss to break-even after the first target is hit, and implementing a trailing stop after the second target is reached to capture as much of the move as possible while protecting gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a preference for trend-following strategies, which aligns well with current market conditions. However, it's crucial to monitor the effectiveness of stop loss and take profit levels closely, ensuring they are optimized for current volatility and market sentiment.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and recent trade performance, maintaining an equal weight across trend-following, breakout, and mean reversion strategies seems appropriate. However, emphasis on trend-following might be slightly increased in bullish or bearish market phases, as indicated by technical and fundamental analysis.
