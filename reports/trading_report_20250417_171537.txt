MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently experiencing a consolidation phase, with a slight bearish sentiment as indicated by the market sentiment data. The recent price action on the H1 timeframe shows a slight downtrend, with the price moving below the MA20 but still above the MA50, indicating a potential for both bullish and bearish movements. The technical indicators such as RSI are near the midpoint, suggesting a lack of strong momentum in either direction. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility and potentially strengthen the USD if the actual figures exceed forecasts. Considering the multi-timeframe analysis, the pair is showing signs of indecision, with a slight bearish bias in the short term but maintaining above key support levels in the longer timeframes.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A significant break below key support levels on the H1 timeframe or unexpected news events causing high volatility.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a mix of outcomes, indicating a need for better alignment with market sentiment and economic events. The use of trailing stops and staged profit-taking has been beneficial in protecting against reversals and securing profits.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the upcoming high-impact USD news, it may be prudent to adjust strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on mean reversion in the short term, capitalizing on potential volatility spikes. Trend following and breakout strategies should still be considered but with a more cautious approach until clear trends emerge post-news.
