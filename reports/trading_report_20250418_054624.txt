MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bullish sentiment in the recent price action, supported by the moving averages and RSI indicators. The pair is trading above the MA20 and MA50, indicating a bullish trend. The MACD is positive, suggesting momentum is in favor of the bulls. The recent economic events and upcoming CPI data could introduce volatility, potentially benefiting a trend-following strategy. The market sentiment is bullish, and retail positioning shows a significant short interest, which could lead to a short squeeze scenario.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.13736
Stop Loss: 1.136
Take Profit Levels: [1.139, 1.1405, 1.142]
Risk Percent: 2%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a BUY position is based on the current bullish trend, supported by technical indicators across multiple timeframes. The entry range is chosen to optimize entry around the current market price, with a stop loss set to protect against short-term volatility. The take profit levels are set at key resistance levels, with a trailing stop to secure profits as the price moves favorably.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 or H4 timeframe, significant bearish news event, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take partial profits at each take profit level, moving the stop loss to break even after reaching the first target and then trailing the stop by 0.0020 to protect further gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a bullish bias in the market, with the trend-following strategy aligning well with current market conditions. However, the risk management strategy needs to be closely monitored to ensure the maximum account risk and daily drawdown limits are not breached.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the performance of recent trades, maintaining a balanced approach between trend following, breakout, and mean reversion strategies is advisable. However, a slight increase in the weight of the trend-following strategy could be beneficial, given the current bullish momentum.
