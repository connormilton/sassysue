MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bullish sentiment in recent price action, with the price currently trading above both the MA20 and MA50, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. The RSI at 56.99 suggests the market is not yet overbought, providing room for further upside. The MACD is also positive, supporting the bullish view. However, the upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility. The correlation analysis indicates a moderate positive relationship with GBP/USD and Gold, suggesting EUR/USD might follow similar bullish trends. Given the recent economic events, the market has absorbed the ECB's decision, and the focus now shifts to the USD CPI data. The sentiment analysis shows a majority bullish outlook among traders.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in USD CPI data from forecast, indicating stronger USD; reversal patterns on H1 or H4 timeframes; breaking below the updated stop loss level.
Partial Profit Taking: Consider taking partial profits at 1.1390 and moving the stop loss to break-even once the first target is hit. Further profits can be taken at 1.1405 and 1.1420, with the option to employ a trailing stop from the second target to capture additional gains while protecting from reversal.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a bullish bias in line with market sentiment and technical indicators. However, the outcomes are pending, highlighting the importance of risk management and the need to adapt to market changes swiftly, especially ahead of significant economic announcements.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the performance of recent trades, maintaining a balanced approach between trend following, breakout, and mean reversion strategies seems appropriate. However, emphasis should be placed on trend following in the short term, given the clear bullish signals across multiple timeframes.
