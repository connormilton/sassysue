MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a bullish sentiment in the short term, supported by a bullish market sentiment of 62% and high trading volume. The recent price action on the H1 and H4 timeframes indicates a consolidation phase with potential for an upward breakout, given the pair's recent highs and the RSI being above 60, suggesting strength in the current trend. The moving averages on the H1 timeframe indicate a bullish trend, with the price above both MA20 and MA50. However, the close proximity of the price to the key resistance levels and the upcoming high-impact USD CPI data suggest potential volatility and risk of reversal. Intermarket correlations, particularly the positive correlation with GBP/USD and negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggest external factors may also influence the EUR/USD pair's movements.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in USD CPI data from forecasts, reversal patterns on H1 or H4 timeframes, or a break below MA50 on the H1 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not met the target due to market volatility and possibly entering positions too early in the trend without confirmation from multiple timeframes or considering upcoming economic events. The risk management strategy was adequate, but the timing of entries needs refinement.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, adjusting the strategy weights to prioritize trend-following slightly less and increase emphasis on breakout strategies could capitalize on the current market conditions. This adjustment reflects the need to wait for clearer signals of a breakout or reversal before entering trades, especially in light of upcoming high-impact economic events.
