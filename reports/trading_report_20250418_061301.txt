MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing mixed signals across various timeframes. On the H1 and H4 timeframes, the price is hovering around the 20-period MA, indicating a potential consolidation phase. The daily timeframe shows a bullish trend over the past few days, with the price moving from 1.1282 to recent levels around 1.137. The RSI on the H1 timeframe is above 60, suggesting some bullish momentum, while the MACD indicates a slight bullish bias as well. Intermarket correlations show a bearish sentiment for EUR/USD, with a bearish institutional bias. The upcoming USD CPI data could significantly impact the pair, potentially strengthening the USD if the data exceeds forecasts. Considering these factors, the market sentiment is currently bearish, suggesting caution.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in upcoming economic data, reversal patterns on lower timeframes, or a shift in market sentiment towards a more bullish outlook for the USD.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A as no new position is recommended at this time.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not met the expected outcomes, indicating a potential misalignment between strategy application and market conditions. The use of trend-following strategies in a market showing signs of consolidation may not have been optimal.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, adjusting the strategy weights to reduce emphasis on trend-following (0.5 to 0.3) and increase focus on mean reversion (1.0 to 1.2) could be beneficial. This adjustment reflects the current market phase of consolidation and the potential for reversals around key levels.
