MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is showing signs of consolidation with a slight bullish bias in sentiment and technical indicators. The recent price action on the H1 and H4 timeframes indicates a potential for upward movement, supported by a bullish market sentiment of 65%. The moving averages on the H1 timeframe show the price hovering around the MA20 and above the MA50, suggesting a bullish trend in the short term. The RSI is near the midpoint, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, allowing room for price movement in either direction. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the actual exceeds forecast, which needs to be considered. The correlation analysis suggests EUR/USD has a positive relationship with GBP/USD and Gold, both of which are currently in a strong position, potentially supporting a bullish outlook for EUR/USD.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: BUY
Entry Price: 1.1365
Stop Loss: 1.1345
Take Profit Levels: [1.1385, 1.14, 1.142]
Risk Percent: 2%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a BUY position is based on the consolidation pattern near key moving averages with a bullish sentiment and technical indicators suggesting an upward breakout. The entry range is chosen to capitalize on the current market conditions with a stop loss placed below the recent low to mitigate risk. The take profit levels are set at key psychological and technical resistance levels, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe, significant bearish news event, or if the USD CPI data significantly exceeds forecasts, indicating a stronger USD.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 50% profit at the first target level and move the stop loss to the entry point. At the second target, take another 25% and move the stop loss to the first target level. Let the remaining 25% run to the final target with a trailing stop.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades indicate a need to better align with market sentiment and economic events, suggesting an improvement in timing entries around significant news releases.
Strategy Adjustments: Increase emphasis on sentiment analysis and intermarket correlations, particularly around key economic releases, to better anticipate market movements.
