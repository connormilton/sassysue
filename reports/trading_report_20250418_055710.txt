MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bullish trend in the recent hours, supported by technical indicators such as a rising RSI and positive MACD values. The price is currently trading above both the MA20 and MA50, indicating a potential continuation of the bullish momentum. However, market sentiment is bearish, and upcoming USD CPI data might impact the pair significantly. The correlation analysis suggests that EUR/USD movements are somewhat aligned with GBP/USD and inversely correlated with the US_DE Spread, indicating external market factors could influence the EUR/USD pair.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in USD CPI data from forecasts, reversal patterns on H1/H4 timeframes, or a shift in market sentiment towards bullish for USD.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have not met the target due to market volatility and perhaps an over-reliance on bullish sentiment in a bearish market sentiment context. The strategy may benefit from incorporating more diverse indicators and adjusting risk management in response to market sentiment and economic events.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the bearish sentiment, it might be prudent to adjust the strategy weights to place more emphasis on mean reversion strategies, especially ahead of significant economic announcements. This could help capitalize on short-term market movements that do not align with the longer-term trend.
