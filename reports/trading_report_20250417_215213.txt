MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a mix of bullish and bearish signals across different timeframes. The recent price action on the H1 timeframe indicates a slight increase in volatility, with prices oscillating around key moving averages (MA20 and MA50), suggesting a potential for either direction. The RSI at 59.13 leans towards bullish momentum, but not strongly. The MACkaD signals are near zero, indicating a lack of strong momentum. The ATR suggests moderate volatility. The upcoming USD CPI event could introduce significant volatility. Intermarket correlations show a moderate positive correlation with GBP/USD and Gold, suggesting EUR/USD might follow similar trends. Market sentiment is neutral with a slight bullish tilt among retail traders.
