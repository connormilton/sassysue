MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a bullish sentiment in recent market data, with technical indicators suggesting a continued uptrend. The RSI at 56.99 indicates a positive momentum without being overbought. The MACD is above its signal line, further supporting the bullish trend. The price is currently above both the MA20 and MA50, suggesting a strong uptrend in the short term. However, the proximity to key resistance levels and upcoming high-impact USD CPI data warrants caution. Intermarket correlations and recent economic events have been considered, particularly the ECB's decision to maintain interest rates, which may continue to support the EUR strength against the USD.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant deviation in USD CPI data from forecasts indicating stronger USD, reversal patterns on H1 or H4 timeframes, or breaking below the updated stop loss level.
Partial Profit Taking: Given the current open positions, consider taking partial profits at the first take profit level (1.139) to secure gains and adjust the trailing stop to just below this level once hit, ensuring profits are protected while still allowing for further gains.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a strong reliance on trend-following strategies without sufficient consideration for potential reversal signals or economic data releases that could impact the currency pair. While the bullish trend has been correctly identified, the risk management strategy needs fine-tuning to better protect against sudden market movements.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and recent performance, there is a need to balance the strategy weights more cautiously. While trend-following remains valid, incorporating a higher sensitivity to breakout signals and mean reversion opportunities could provide more balanced trade entries and exits, especially around key economic announcements.
