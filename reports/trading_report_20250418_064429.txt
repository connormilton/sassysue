MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD pair shows a slight bullish trend on the H1 timeframe, with prices moving above the MA_20 and MA_50, indicating potential for further upside. The RSI at 63 suggests a strong but not overbought market, and the MACD above its signal line supports the bullish momentum. However, the sentiment data indicates a bearish outlook among traders, which could signal upcoming resistance or a potential reversal. The upcoming USD CPI event could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the actual exceeds forecast, impacting EUR/USD negatively. Intermarket correlations, especially the negative correlation with the US_DE Spread, suggest that a stronger USD could pull EUR/USD down. Considering these factors, a cautious approach is warranted.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Significant surpassing of USD CPI forecasts, indicating a stronger USD, or a reversal pattern on the H1/H4 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A as no new trade is recommended at this moment.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades, all being BUY positions, indicate a bullish bias that may not fully account for market sentiment or upcoming economic events that could impact currency strength. This suggests a need for a more balanced approach, considering both technical indicators and market sentiment.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed signals from technical indicators and sentiment data, adjusting the strategy weights to give more emphasis on mean reversion (1.5) and less on trend following (0.3) and breakout (1.2) could be beneficial. This adjustment reflects the need for caution in a potentially volatile market environment.
