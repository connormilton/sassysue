MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the current market conditions, the EUR/USD pair is exhibiting signs of consolidation with a slight bearish sentiment in the market. The recent price action is hovering around key moving averages, the H1 timeframe, and the RSI and MACD indicators suggest a lack of strong momentum in either direction. Intermarket correlations, especially with the GBP/USD and the US/DE yield spread, indicate a potential for EUR weakness against the USD. The upcoming USD CPI and EUR Industrial Production events could introduce volatility. The sentiment analysis shows a bearish overall sentiment with high volume, suggesting a cautious approach.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A significant shift in market sentiment post-economic announcements or a breakout from the current price consolidation range.
Partial Profit Taking: N/A

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades indicate a trend-following strategy may not be optimal in current market conditions characterized by consolidation and lack of clear direction. The win rate and daily profit targets are not meeting expectations, suggesting a need for strategy refinement.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, it may be prudent to adjust strategy weights, increasing the weight on mean reversion to 0.4 and reducing trend following and breakout to 0.3 each. This adjustment reflects the current market's consolidation phase and the potential for capturing profits from price movements within a defined range.
