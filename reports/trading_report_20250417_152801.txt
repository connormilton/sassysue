MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a mix of bullish and bearish signals across different timeframes. The recent price action suggests a slight bearish bias as the price is currently below the MA_20 but above the MA_50, indicating potential for short-term downward movement but overall medium-term stability. The RSI at 35.85 suggests the pair is nearing oversold territory, which could limit downside potential. The upcoming high-impact USD CPI data could introduce volatility. Given the bearish market sentiment but bullish institutional bias, there's a conflicting outlook. The recent trades show a mix of buy and sell strategies, indicating a market at a crossroads.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: The recent trades indicate a lack of clear direction, with both buy and sell positions opened based on mean reversion and trend following strategies. This suggests a need for better alignment with prevailing market conditions and sentiment. The win rate at 0.0% with 0/4 trades winning indicates a critical need for strategy reassessment.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market analysis, adjusting the strategy weights to favor mean reversion slightly more could be beneficial in the current market condition where prices are fluctuating around key moving averages. This adjustment should be made cautiously, with a keen eye on upcoming economic events and market sentiment shifts.
