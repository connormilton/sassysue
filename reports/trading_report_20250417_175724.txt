MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently exhibiting a consolidation pattern with a slight bearish sentiment in the market. The recent price action on the H1 timeframe shows a narrowing range, indicating potential for a breakout. The Moving Averages (MA20 and MA50) are converging, suggesting indecision in the market. The MACD is slightly below the signal line, indicating bearish momentum, but the difference is minimal, suggesting weak momentum. The RSI is near the midpoint (48.97), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Intermarket correlations and recent economic events, such as the ECB Interest Rate Decision and the upcoming USD CPI data, could influence the pair's direction. Given the mixed signals from technical indicators and the bearish market sentiment, a cautious approach is warranted.

Performance Assessment: As there are no past trades to assess, it's crucial to establish a baseline for future performance evaluation. Initial observations suggest a balanced approach to risk management and strategy application is necessary.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed signals from technical indicators, maintaining equal weights on trend following, breakout, and mean reversion strategies seems appropriate. However, readiness to adjust these weights based on evolving market conditions and performance feedback is essential.
