MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD has shown a slight bearish sentiment in the market with a current bearish sentiment of 62%. The price action on the H1 timeframe is showing consolidation with a slight bearish bias as the latest close is below the MA20 but still above the MA50, indicating mixed signals. The MACD is slightly below the signal line, suggesting bearish momentum, while the RSI is near the neutral 50 mark, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The ATR indicates moderate volatility. The upcoming USD CPI data could introduce volatility, potentially strengthening the USD if the data exceeds expectations. Given the mixed technical signals and upcoming economic events, a cautious approach is warranted.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: OPEN
Direction: SELL
Entry Price: 1.136
Stop Loss: 1.138
Take Profit Levels: [1.134, 1.132, 1.13]
Risk Percent: 2%
Strategy: trend_following
Reasoning: The decision to enter a SELL position is based on the bearish market sentiment, the anticipation of USD strength from the upcoming CPI data, and the technical setup indicating a potential reversal from the recent consolidation phase. The entry range is chosen to capitalize on the current market conditions with a stop loss placed above the recent high to mitigate risk. The take profit levels are set at key psychological and technical support levels, allowing for staged profit-taking.

EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: A reversal pattern on the H1 timeframe or a significant bullish news event that could impact USD strength.
Partial Profit Taking: Take 33% of the position off at each take profit level to lock in profits while allowing the remainder of the position to capture further potential downside.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades indicate a need to refine entry points and stop loss placements, considering the market's volatility and economic news impact. The strategy should adapt to incorporate more stringent criteria for trend confirmation and breakout validation.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and mixed success of strategies, a balanced approach towards trend following, breakout, and mean reversion strategies should be maintained. However, emphasis should be placed on improving the accuracy of trend following signals, perhaps by incorporating additional indicators or adjusting parameters for better market sensitivity.
