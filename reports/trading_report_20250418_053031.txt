MARKET ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EUR/USD is currently showing a consolidation pattern on the H1 timeframe, with recent price action hovering around the 1.1372-1.1373 area. The moving averages on the H1 timeframe indicate a slight bullish bias, with the price trading above the MA_20 and MA_50. The RSI at 56.99 suggests the market is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for potential movement in either direction. The MACD is slightly above its signal line, indicating a weak bullish momentum. The ATR on the H1 timeframe suggests moderate volatility. Multi-timeframe analysis shows a general uptrend on the H4 and Daily timeframes, but with recent pullbacks indicating potential consolidation or reversal points. Intermarket correlations and upcoming economic events, particularly the USD CPI m/m data, could introduce volatility and directional movement.

TRADING DECISION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action: WAIT
EXIT STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early Exit Conditions: Exit early if the price breaks below the new stop loss level before the CPI data release, indicating a stronger USD or if there is a significant bearish reversal pattern on the H1 or H4 timeframe.
Partial Profit Taking: If the market moves favorably post-CPI announcement, consider taking partial profits at 1.1390 and adjust the trailing stop to protect the remaining position.

SELF IMPROVEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Assessment: Recent trades have shown a bullish bias based on trend-following strategies. However, the market has entered a consolidation phase, indicating that the strategy might benefit from incorporating more nuanced indicators or patterns that better capture market sentiment during periods of consolidation or potential reversal.
Strategy Adjustments: Given the current market conditions and the mixed success of recent trades, it might be beneficial to adjust strategy weights to place a greater emphasis on mean reversion in times of consolidation, while still maintaining a component of trend following for when clear trends re-establish.
